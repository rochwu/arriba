Very many years ago I was playing Rebuild 3 and had this idea of doing something like it but instead of doing everything yourself you had commanders. Back then I had no skills.

Then many years later, I started doing board games and learned of the worker placement mechanic and how there were some using dice as workers. But there wasn't any inspiration of what to do about it.

Then I came upon Dark Forest Village and everything was so well built and finally made me start my own incremental.

So this has no goal, maybe learn Solid, maybe do something with it. But hey at least there's some worker placement stuff going on, not sure if it's even a game at this point.

This isn't even an incremental....
